of the Church would be, before God and the people, the surest
warrant for a benefice.¹

By hoarding up riches that belong to the poor, and by
accumulating temporal dignities, the clergy sins, from the lowest
ranks evento the Pope. He should be the holiest ot them all,
since holiness alone should give him that title.2 If he is, God
has chosen him3 if not, he cannot be Ρορει,8 since God's choice
is of the most worthy. Itis nottho Pope’s business to grant
livings or to decide questions of political strife. No one can
claim the Papal dignity, that has not been called thereto by
God.⁴ Whoso, through pride or greed assumes these honours
is sels-excommunicated3 they therefore that do so evidently
care only for what is temporal and disregard the things of the
spirit. And so it were better for the Church, were there no such
'imperial' Popes‚⁶ and were the Church, as formerly, to elect
aChief, or (as did the Apostles of the heathens) to select some
one whom they could depose if they saw that the spirit of
Satan was in him. Thence follows that it is sheer foolishneas
in the Pope to bestow a principality on the Church. If he

does he goes beyond his powers. Nor has he the right to
lay any restrictions or prohibitions on men who know more
than he and who possess the Power of the Keys in a higher
de ee.

gr If he alone can be Pope who is the holiest of all, does it

not follow, as a necessary consequence, that every sin which
he commits must strip him of his Pontifical garments?⁶ Yet is
not this contrary to the law of the Church, according to which
