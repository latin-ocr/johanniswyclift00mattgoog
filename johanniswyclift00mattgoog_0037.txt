poraries, as to the election of Urban VI. Those who made this
choice, may have made it badly, and therefore it may not be
valid‚ if we consider them alone; yet it is valid, so long as it
answers to God's will, and as the Pope lives a holy life.¹ Our
theologiam, in the second place, see clearly that the Church
would be far better off were there to be no ‘Imperialized‘
Pope,2 or in other words if the Papacy were not accompanied
by secular power, and had no subsequent secular aims. Thirdly
they see considering the great virtues with which Urban VI
is adorned, that he is the true Pope, chosen by God, because
all holy Bishops are Popes.⁸ What then is essentiali The works
of the elected one make for our belief that hc is raised by
God to this dignity.⁴ How can it be otherwise? If we corneto
traditions, Robert's party has the same as ours.⁵ The faithful
theologian condemns neither of the two3 both may exist, asin
Apostolic times.

It is of no use to set against this view Grosseteste's
praises of the Pope and Cardinals. He depicts thern as they
should be, not as they are. And whoso says that the Pope is
the soil out of which all advantages to the Church must spring,
thereby condemns the ApostleS, who believed in nothing
of the sort. Faith is independent of the Pope. When there is
an interregnum, when there is a reprobate on St. Peter's Chair,
this does not destroy the Church.

ιι. It may be objected that according both to Nature and
to Scripture, the Church must have one leader. It is true; but
the Pope is not such as he should be. What are the qualities
of a true Pope? St. Bernard has enumerated thern in 34 points.
If he does not possess them, heis no pope; rather a horrible
