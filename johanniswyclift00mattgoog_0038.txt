monster, The ideal Pope, such as St. Bernard wishes him to
be, is a true follower of Christ; he does not endeavour, as an
‘Imperial' Pope does, to obtain temporal wealth and power, but
does his duty humbly, always ready to give up temporal pos-
sessions, should the good of the Church require it. It may
happen that both these characters are combined in one man,
in other wordS, that a worldly-minded Cardinal, having been
elected, may be a true Pope notwithstanding3 but the diffe-
rence will soon appear. A true Pope will renounce the rights
bestowed upon him by the will of the Emperor, and only con·
sider the real meaning of his title.l In the old Covenant there
was a High Priest, and different degrees in the priesthood; so
it is in the New, Christ is the Head of all priests² If therefore
a Pope maintains that he is the Head of the Church Universal,
he at once sets himself above Christ: the very thing that Anti·
christ does.³

Itis asked whether, according to these principles, a wo·
man, if she be very holy, or a layman can be a Pope. Certainly
the Blessed Virgin was the most holy of all women: but a
Pope must be one of the faithful whose life is like that of
Christ Women are therefore excluded, being unable to preach
the Gospel on account of the weakness of her sex. The history
of the female Pope Agnes shows that she fraudulently passed
herself off as a man.⁴ A layman, however, can be Pope; but
of course we can by no means admit that the priesthood will
ever be so corrupt that a layman will be invested with Papal
power. Should this come to pass, he would possess the priest-
hood, even though he had learned no single one of the Seven
