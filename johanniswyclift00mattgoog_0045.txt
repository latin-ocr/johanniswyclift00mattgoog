phantoms they evoke3 auditis just this that has rendered the
Church worldly and completely changed its constitution¹ But

worthy foreigners no longer get tithes and revenues out of
England; these would go to worthy priests who faithfully
fulfil their duty. The holiness of their life and the edification
