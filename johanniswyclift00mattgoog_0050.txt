day, it does so from a point of view different from that of tha
Bohemians, who esteem in Hus the man whose activity stirred
the Western world to its inmost depths, as the Reformer of the
Christian Occidental Church. To appreciata his work today,
we must study Hus' so·called Reform Tractates. They are
few in number, but all so penetrated by Wyelif’s doctrines
that not one of them, not a single point in them that bears on
reformati0n‚ belongs to Hus. For instance, were we to re·
print (taking only his greatest works De Ecclesia, and the con·
troversial tractates against Palecz and Stanislas von Znaim),
all the passages which Hus has taken word for word from
Wyclif, there would remain nothing that belongs to Hus him·
self, save a few polemical passages directed against his Bo·
hemian adversaries. When we note that even his lesser works
on Reformation are penetrated by Wyelif’s teachings and are
presented to us in a thoroughly Wyeliffian garb; when we find
that his sermons are Wyelif's sermons, word for word;¹ when
we know that he caused long quotations from Wyclifs works
to be posted on the walls of his Holy Church of Bethlehem;
that Wyelif's teachings were at the very basis even of Hus'
Confhssion, and that there are many documentary proofs that
Hus became a reformer from the time when he perused the
Englishman’s works:² how is it possible to say that it is ‘logi-
cally and historically mere nonsense’⁸ to maintain that Hussitism
was but an artificially evolved form of Wyeliffianism? Such
violent language does more harm than good to the cause it is
intended to uphold. Take Wyelif’s work out of Hus' writings
as a reformet, and there no longer exists what the Christian
world once understood by ‘Hussitism'. Hus would continue
to be not without merit as a Bohemian writer, but he would
be no longer mentioned in history. It was Wyelif's doctrine

¹ ln my edition of Wyelil's Sermones, Vol. l, Introduction, p. xxti, l have
written more about Hus' adaptatione, and especially about those passages in which
lius substitutes Bolentia for Anglla. ² 1 have collected these passages in my
book, Hes and Wyclry (Progne, 1884). They might be considerably added to at
the present day. ³ Cesky Canopis historicly llll, 214.
