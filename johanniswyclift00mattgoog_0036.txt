nunooucwou. XXIX

of Gregory XI has employed soldiers to accomplish so Catholic
a work;¹ and so, too, have secular princes formerly set the
Church free from Anti-Popes. Again two Popes are at odds, as
in Henry III's time. Each accuses the other oi heresy; since
the world began, there never was fiercer wrangling. And as
formerly the High Priest accused Christ of blasphemy, so now
ignorant disciples of Antichrist accuse those oi heresy who
(like Wyclii) struggle for the true privileges of the Church.
Thus a certain man, ignorant in spite of his title of Doctor,
has publicly (now that he possesses a fat living) treated the
true defendere oi the Church as heretics and ioes.² Wyclif is
comforted by thinking that the Apostles iared no better, and
also that the Κίιπς3 himself is in the same position.¹ Without
taking account of his youth, they call him a heretic, who has
hired mercenaries against the Church. But are we to believe
those men? They are like the cardinals who deserted Urban VI,
and now declare solemnly in writing and by their legates that
the election which they themselves made is invalid and that
Urban VI is not the lawful Pope.⁴ Our theologians say,⁵ on the
contrary, that Urban’s election was not lawful on the part of
the CardinaIS, but that it is valid notwithstanding on account
of God’s choice, so long as the Pope shows himself to be

worthy, by actions that really become a Pope. Itis clear how ,
totally different Wyclii’s position is from that of his contem·

¹ As to these mercenaries os Urban Vl., compare Theodoricus de Nyem dc
Scismatc, lib. l, cap.Vl. Otto os Brunswiclr, however, is not necessarily the only
person alluded to here. ² p. 253. lt is not clear to which of Wyclil¹s adversaries
this passage refers. ³Sed est consolatio quedam mundana p. 253. ⁴ p. 254.
ἔ· licre Wyclis expresses himself very clearly. nnd the ideas which he expresses, even
il he did not name himself in the following page, completely answer to the doctrine
which he has hitherto developed throughout the tractate. As to the pleas brought
lorward by the Cardinals who came to England from Urban Vl. and Robert, see
Walsingham: Venerunt et nuncii eorundem cardinalium afferentes literas decem
signatas sigillis, petentes ct ipsi auxilium prestare cardinalibus, allegantes fortiter
pro eisdem. Sed domino Deo lavante repulsi sunt apostatici nuncil et admissi papales
promissumque subsidium papae gratanter quam cito tempus exigeret oportunum. See
also the Littera anticardinalium missa diversis gentibus contra papam Walsingham ll.
213-216.
