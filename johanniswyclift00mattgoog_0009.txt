1. contenta ol De potestate Papa.

Wyclif, in the volume now before us, begins by putting
forward certain fundamental notioris. To treat of the power
which belongs to the Pope, it is necessary to have aclear idea
of the nature of this power, and of the different significatione
given to the words even in the earliest times. It is only then
that we shall know what the power of the Church is according
to Christ’s ordinance; or in other words, what hierarchy He
gave it. and how this hierarehy has shaped 3ηά evolved itself.
To speak of the Church, we must know what the Church is,
what its various parts are, and how different the Churchis now
from what it was in the days of the Apostles. Whilst Wyclif
appeals to Holy Scripture almost at every page, and makes it
the basis of his expositions, it is easy to see that he assumes
a previous acquaintance with his treatises De Ecclesia and Dc
Veritate, which had been written before.

What is Power? According to Aristotle, it is the principle
of movement, of production and destructiom it is either increata,
an attribute of (iod alone, -- 3ηά as such infinite and eternal; —
or created in time and either spiritual or material. Spiritual
power, given to the creature, is indeed permanent 3ηά in·
destructible, but may be limited in its action. Material power
may be gained or lost.

Another kind of power is the capacity of any creature to
be influenced from without; and therefore there must be, not
only active, but passive power.

A third kind is the capacity of doing a thing aright: this
is either internal or external. In man, according to Anselm, it
is called free-will, which may be - either totally or only in
part - lost by sin.

Finally, power may be an acquired capacity to produce an
alteration in another subject. In man, it is either supernatural,
3ηά designed for the utility oi the Church, or political and
interced to resist the enemies of the Church.

A perusal of Holy scripture will show us that there are
many other significations atthis word. The sixth Choir of Angels,
