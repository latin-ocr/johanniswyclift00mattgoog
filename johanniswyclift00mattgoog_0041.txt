been overcharged if all such vestments and customs had been
noted therein. It contains only what is essential. Now the clergy
puts the essential in the last place, and human traditions, even
when they are heretical, are made much of. The Church is
burdened with such beresies‚ and they who introduced them
sinned grievously. Nothing can be worse than those graduations
which a worldly legislation requires for admittance into the
clergy. It should be just the contrary here; the poorest‚ the
most humble‚ is the highest. So also should all priests be friends
one to another now, as they were in the days of the Apostles.
The position in which the Church stands now towards the se·
cular powers may readily be exemplified. Christ, who paid the
tribute due to the Emperor for Himself and His disciples, threw
all temporal power aside. Now it is quite the contrary. The Church
ought to be purged of these errors.¹ Here comes the famous
blasphemy which asserts that Popes have power immensely
greater than other Bishops, because they can grant much
more abundant indulgences‚ dispensation5‚ and other privileges,
By that means they claim for themselves a far greater fullness
of power than Christ gave them. Gregory the Great objected
to be called Pope and set above all others. In truth‚ all that
the Bible demands of the clergy can be done by a simple
priest3 he can even ordain others²

But how can the Pope be said to be superfluous, ifa Head
is needed to decide differences within the Church, and grant
parishes end privileges? indeed, laymen are blind3 they think
that, were it not for the Church hierarchy, secular government
would itself come to ruin. And yet the condition oi the Church
and the Govemment was never better than during the three
first centuries, when no such hierarchy existed. With what
veneration would all the people welcome a Pope who became
such by Christ’s ordinationi And is not secular government‚ both
in time and by nature, anterior to the endowment of the
Church? Were the Church in the same position in which it
