under (iod's leading hand in the early times. If they happen to
fall into deadly sin, they lose their power, if they ever had it.¹
Their decisions have not the authority of the Bible, and we
need not believe either that they are true, or that their authors
were the heads of the Church. Nor do we know whether a
given Pope is predestined to salvation —— that is, whether he
even belongs to the Church.² And therefore Christians have no
need to take sides when lavo Popes quarrel about the Primucy,·
it suffices to believe that Christ is the Head of the Church.³
And as to their decisione, does not one Pope contradict an-
other? What has one Pope to make us believe him rather than
another? Holiness of life alone; if he strays from the ways oi
(lod, there is no one more hypocritical and mendacious than
he. (iod forbid that we should believe a Pope more than the
Doctors of the Church! His writings and deeds often contradict
the Bible. We should believe a man only when God speaks
through his lips3 so his words and acts are to be suspected as
mendacious. If the Papal decisions gave authority to the Bible,
then the Decretals would be above Holy Writ.

All the Epistles of the Apostles have the same authority.
Peter rejoiced when Paul rebuked him; so should the clergy
do even nour. Wyclif proceeds to answer objections to his
doctrine. If it be said that it is contradicted by all the laws
and canons of the Church, the clergy (he replies) can rely only
on God's authority, for we do not know what authority, ir
any, has been given to man by God. Ii again it be objected
that there must be a fixed standard both as concerns holiness
and power, for otherwise there could bc no obedience amongst
men, and the higher authority of the Church would be destroyed;
he replies: Sanctity is the sign of authority, but not its standard.

The Pope claims to represent Christ: if he goes astray
from the ways of the ApostleS, he is in the words of the Bible.

¹ Potestas ei quam in principio habuerunt est eis subtracta p. 110. ² Quia
nescimus si preecitus fuerit vel membrum sancte matris ecclesie p. 111. We see that
such ι passage presupposes the knowledge of De Ecclesia. ³Wyclil uses other
expressions on p. ¹¹¹3 but the sense is the earne. He returns repeatedly to this point.
