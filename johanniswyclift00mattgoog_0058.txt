of B had no special acquaintance with his subject-metten for an
omitted word supplied by A in a side-note, has been placed by
him in a side-note too Several other details lead us to conclude
that there is, between A and B, a relation of dependence.

Itis of interest, from a certain point of view, to read the
side-notes. They show that the copyist of A was of the Ca·
tholic way of thinking. He takes care to add in oue place
(f. 225l’) the following words: Nota argumentum optimum pro
papum esse et pro eius regimine, sed cave extortam evasionem
itlius, . .. The arguments in favour of Papacy and Papal go·
verument please him, but the author's final conclusions do not
There are to be found besides such remarks as: Cave cave
sooeum3 or Hic contradicit sibi; all of which show that the copyist
was not friendly to Wyclif’s theological system. The reader will
also find (f. 395-397) some variants added under the lettering C,
from Cod. XI. E. 3. This MS. also contains (f. 582-541‘), the
Protestation'es multiplices Magistris tolonnis Wictrff.

his Anna von Luremburg, daughter of the Emperor chartulis,

dings of the Imperial Academy of Sciences‚ vol XXl‚ there is
also a more lengthy one, taken out of De Potestate Pape, with
several variants of some importance. As we see by the rocently
printed Catalogue of Prague University Library‚ these Prote·
stations are to be found not only in Cod. XI. E. 3 (now
Cod. 2050) but also in Codices X. H. 12 (now 1990) and XI.
D. 9 (now 2043).

4. Date ot De potestate Pane.

As already said, we suppose the reader to be already ac-
quainted with Wyclif’s two great works: De Ecclesia and De
Veritate Sacre Scriptura¹ This gives us a clue to the date

scripture3 de quo patet cap. xlv libri proximi; see below p. ι. ct. De Veritete sacre
scripture ed. buddensieg 1, 331. As a mutter of tect, both these works precede the

present one in the Summa.
