keep Christ's flock; but if a so·called Pope sleeps in spiritual
slumbers, he stands sslf-condemned and unfit for his office¹
When Popes wrangle about plenitude of power, whilst their
life and deeds are barren, and forgiveness of sins and penalties
is sold for money, and those who live according to Christ’s
example are persecuted by them, they are truly Antichrists.
To them do these words apply. “Many will come in my name,
saying, I am Christ, and will seduce many.” Such is literalis
the case leuas, whilsl two claimanls are wrangling sor the Vicar
of Clu‘isl's position.² But Christ says: “Believe them not·,” that
is, those who now essert themselves to be Popes. These tivo
ought lo be satisfieri with poverly,· thal would reconcile them. Since
it is impossible to know, either by their elections or by their

peace in the faith of Christ, until the Church shall decide be·
tween them; and supposing that they are both good Catholic
priests, we are ready to submit to either as the Apostles sub·
mitted to Peter. But whosoever forces us to obey by deeds of
violence, is suspect by the very fact. Peter exacted no other
obedience save faith in Christ and the imitation of this example.
He craved no temporal dominion, nor money, oor honours. Thus
neither the one (Urban VI) nor the other (Clement VII) has
any right to extort money from kingdoms and nations or from
private persons, unless he can find authority for his act in
Holy Writ. But should one of them preech the doctrine of
Christ with signs and miracles, as Peter spread the saith, then
would the people follow him joyfully: and only in this case
would it be lawful to follow such a leader. But whoso usurps
these functions to get money or to satisfy his pride, commits

grievous sin. But now simony has taken such deep root, that
both the floclr and the shepherd are rushing to destruction,
unless God brings back the clergy to evangelical poverty. Who,
therefore, is Christ's true Vicat? He that lives like Christ and
