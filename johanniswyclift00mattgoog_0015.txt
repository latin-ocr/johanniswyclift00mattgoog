VIII lNTROllUCTION.

Moreover, neither Peter, nor Paul, nor any of the other
Apostles, withheld the bishops whom they ordained from watch-
ing over the people3 Peter's distinguished position had no bear·
ing upon jurisdiction, nor did it give him any juridical rights
over the whole Church Militant¹ The other Apostles, without
Peter’s permission, founded Churches in divers places: Paul

order of St. Francis (the Minorites) a heavenly and entirely
perfect Order, because it is most like the earthly condition of
Christand the Apostles, is an utterance made in this spirit. The
Roman Church and its Doctors - especially those of the
Minorito Order — should, therefore, uphold the principle of
Evangelical poverty3 yet they do the contrary, and despise a
