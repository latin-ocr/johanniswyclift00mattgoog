yet not Pope, and vice versa.¹ The choice of a Pope does not
proceed from the election and power of men, but from the
grace of God. We have just as much power to predestine a
manto eternal salvation. The Apostles did not elect Matthias,
but preyed God to show them whom He had chosen. The
present form of Papal election was introduced since the endow·
ment of the Church and should be considered as a merely
human procedure, and by no means as a channel of God’s
grace. It may sometimes happen that a worthy man is elected,
conformably to God's will, but the reverse may also occur.
Let us grasp the idea contained in the words, “Pope”, and
“Supreme‘'; they denote the highest perfection of life, etc; it
follows that God alone chooses a man to be Pope, or Supremo
Bishop. There are thus two elections; one, made by men,
chooses an individual to be Bishop of Rome; another, made by
God, chooses one to be Pope: if the second is wanting, that
person is a Bishop, but not Pope.

By what means has the Bishop of Rome come to be called
Pope? Chronicles show us that the title has a secular origin,
and coincides with the endowment by which the Church be·
came secularized. Ranulphus Higden, the writer whom Wyclif
prefers to consult for his historica] expositione, tells us how
this took place² For such an origin it is oi no use to search
the Scriptures Other chronicles and decrees admit this purely
human origin os the Bishop of Rome's primacy.³ It is not an
article of saith that Clement, Linus, Cletus and the others were
Popes in the modern sense of the word. If we consider the
word “Pope'’ in its widest signification, as it was understood
by Ambrose and Augustine, there is no doubt that Paul, Clement,
and other holy martyre and confessore were Bishops of Rome
and at the same time Popes; and others as well, who excelled
in leading the flock entrusted to their care.
