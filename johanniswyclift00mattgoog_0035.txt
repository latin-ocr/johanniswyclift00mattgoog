he will have nothing to do with either party.¹ Both sides would
do better to reflect on the qualities that a true Pope ought to
possess, and to choose a Pope accordingly. First of all, let the
Church be no longer endowed: endowment has caused all this

misery. How should we interpret the laws concerning the
supremacy of the Church of Rome? To understand this, we
ought not to follow glossators like Johannes de Deo, Johannes
Andrae or Johannes Monachi, who know nothing of theology;
we must hold fast to what St. Jerome says oi the predestinate
believers whose origin is Roman Christianity. These elect are
to be found everywhere, whithersoever they go, whether to
Avignon or elsewhere. It is of these believers, predestined to
salvation, that Jerome’s famous sentence: “Haec est fides, papa
beatissime'', holds good as to the man that the Church οἱ Rome
takes to be Primate. Such believers, being predestined, cannot
be everlastingly condemned, however they may sin, ior they
receive grace. No one should boast of this grace, nevertheless,
since no one can tell whether he is of those Elect. And it
Jerome indicated Pope Damasus as one ol them, he may have
had a revelation on the subject, but we do not know that. He
probably inferred it from his saintly life. What Jerome says of
Damasus cannot be said of every Pope of Rome, for of some
of these, as of Gregory ΧΙ,2 it has been said that they fell
into heresy by greed of lucre. For instance, he condemned
the doctrine that the secular power ought to take away tem·
poral possessions from a backsliding Church.³ Yet the successor

Realm ol England. From this passage we see how he returns to this point conti·
nually. What its final results were is shown in the complete confiscation oi all
Church property by the Hussites.
