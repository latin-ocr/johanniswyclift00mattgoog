at which the present work was written. Buddensieg assigns
the autumn of 1378 as the date of Da Veritarc S. Scriptura¹
Shirley gives the date as ¹378 or 1379·² De Ecclesia, as I have
stated,³ was written in the autumn and winter of 1378. As Dc
Ecclesia and Dc Veritatc were written at the same period, it
follows that Buddensieg’s opinion is the right one. The tractate

Dc Potestate Papa could therefore not have been written either
· before or during the year ¹378· That De Veritate S. Scriptura
was anterior to De Potestate is also proved by the fact that the
former tractate is quoted in the latter, and indeed we find it
quoted with unmistalrable distinctness⁴ We shall thus obtain
as the earliest possible date of this work, the year 1379· Let
us try whether we cannot also obtain a latest possible date,
by finding a reference to De Potestale Papa in one of Wyclif’s
later tractatos. Such a reference we find twice in De Simonia.
Once, when he says that each Apostle in particular, unaware
of any supremacy attaching to St. Peter, ordained Bishops and
priests indifferently.⁵ Another time he tells us that the Popes
formerly begged alms in England, whereas they now claim the
first year's revenue, after each new installation ofa Bishop.⁸
And De Simonia was written either at the end of 1379 or at
the beginning of 1380. We have therefore the year ¹379 as the
date at which Dc Poleslate was written.

In another tractato - De Eucharislia — there is alsoa
reference to De Potestate. “There are”, says Wyclif‚ “many of
the faithful’‘ who do not acknowledge the Bishops of Rome
either as their shepherd or even as members of the Church;
and on the other hand there are other Bishops who bring
more credit to the Church militant than they dol Though the
date of De Eucharislio is not easy to fix, still a close investi·
gation shows us that it appeared before 1382. Thme tractates —
