Decretal which has scripture warrant. But il John XXII. rejects
a doctrine sanctioned by Nicolaus, how are we to believe in
Popes, when one contradicts the other?¹ As Evangelical poverty
leads to perfection, so must too lavish endowments do harm
to the clergy. Riches, according to the belief of holy men, are
a burden to the soul. How then should it not be a thing greatly
to be desired by the clergy, that the laity should take all
worldly power for themselves? From all this we see how awful
it is to condemn as heretica] the doctrine that the laity ought
to aid the clergy by taking away those possessione with which
(on account of the laity’s own immoderate donations) they have
come to be hampered.² These words will remind every one of
the time when Wyclif, from the professorial chair and the pulpit,
demanded the secularization of Church property in England.
This demand is the origin of his hard struggle with the Papacy.
It is a pity, says Wyclif, that our Bishops ignore the Apostolic
example, to which the Pope should encourage the world by
word and daed Wyclif, however, is not a fanatical upholder
of this principle of poverty. He favours a modest competence
which may enable a man to fulfil his duties of a Christian. But
for what the priest has to do, temporal power is unnecessary.
Let us take it from the clergy, and no doubt they will receive
a thousandfold more.

But we are told that the Pope requires this tempora}
sovereignty to support his exalted position3 and the like is
said of Bishops and Abbots. This Wyclif contradicts in the
words of St. Bernard. Many Saints have accepted endowments;

but it is clear that we should follow the Saints only in sofar
as they follow Scriptura. We can rely only upon Saints of the
early times, not on those of more recent date, for the latter
are already tainted by the world. The former were sometimes
in the wrong: how much more the latter! The titles of honour
