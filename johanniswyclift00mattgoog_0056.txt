imnooucnor. XLIX

of which MS. C. 73 of Prague Domlrapitel and MS. 3 F ιι of
the University Library contain the whole tractate; while the
MSS. 3G 16 and 2E3 possess extracts therefrom. When 1
applied to the University Library in Praguc concerning these
two last, 1 was informed on Feb. ι3, 1905, that Shirley’s notice
was not accurate, and that no such extracts were to be found
in those two MSS. The letterings may possibly refer to other
librarios. But in the first volume of the catalogue of MSS. of
the Prague University Library‚ which was published later, it
is noted that in MS. 111 G. 16 (f01.15b) there exists an extract
from De Potestate Ραρε.Ι As to 2E3, Ican give no informa-
tion; but it matters very little, since we possess the whole
tractate in two well-preserved MSS. The copy, which has been
made in Prague by a man of learning and ability, forms the
basis of the present edition.

The Codex C73 (A) has already been employed, though
not described, in the editions of Wyclif’s De Apostasia and De
Biasphemia. I must thanlr Dr. Kamill Krofta‚ the able editores
Acta Urbani et Bonisacii IX (Monumenta Vaticana res Bohemicas
illustrantia, tom. V) for the copy; and also for the descriptions of
the MSS. The MS. contains De Blasphemia, from f. 11 to f. 863
De Apostasia, from f. 86 to f. 161, and lastly De Potestate Pape
from f. 16¹1> to f. ²59¹· The first ten and the eight last leaves
are blank The treatise ends with the words: Explicit tractatus de
potestate pape Johannis W. after which follows on f. 259: Cum
secundum sanctos spectat ad officium doctoris evangelici. This is
the Tractatrrs De Prophetia, which is to be found in MS. III G. rr
oi Prague University Library.²

In this MS. C. 73, after f. 262³ come the words: scriptoris
cuncti memores sint ista legentes, atque precentur ei requiem iu·
bilei. Neb gest tolio dobree boden (= Isto namque dignissimus est).
Finally the MS. contains a great part of the index, which con·
eludes with the words: Secundo principaliter arguit per hoc
quod ex officio et ornamentis sacerdotum. . . .
