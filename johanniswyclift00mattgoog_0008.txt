INTRODUCTION.

Of the twelve books which the Summa Theologiae contains,
the ninth has hitherto not received the attention to which its
contents entitle it. In point of importance only one of all the
twelve can be compared tn it: De Ecclesia, which, together with
De Veritate Sacre Scriptura, precedes Dc Potestate Papa· and
this work would present many obscure passages, but for the
knowledge of the other two. It is because this book was
unknown to the biographers of the English Reformer that not
one of them has correctly described his attitude in regard to
the Papacy: for it contains his theory oi true and false Papacy,
which must be known in order to understand the position which
he takes on this subjectio his later works. AsI intend to deal
with Wyclii’s doctrine in a special treatise, these hints must
suffice ior the present. l must only add that Wyclifs friends
and disciples were perfectly aware how great a treasure they
had in this book. If we peruse the famous treatise, De Ecclesia,
by Huss. which contributed to his conderunation attha Council
os Constance, we shall see that it is but an echo oi Wyclii's
Dc Ecclesia, arrd also of his De Poteslale Pape.

From another standpoint — that of form - this treatise
ought to be highly valued. Even Setting asida the exhaustive
quotations and definitions of the word “Power’‘, in which our
author still keeps strictly to the Scholastic and Aristotelian
method, lle Poteslale Papa would still be, together with the
Trialogus, the most striking production of his pen, on account
of the unity of its contenta: acircurnstance which obliges us to

summarias these contenta at greater length.
