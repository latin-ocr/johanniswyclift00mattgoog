ments would also be more favourable.¹ They say as a proof
of the latter’s inferiority: The Pope was instituted by Christ,
the Emperor by men. This is false. The Pope as he exists at
present was brought in by the Emperor, and Christ instituted

a form of Papacy such as is not to be seen to·day. At present
the Pope trusts in his privileges; a true servant of God laughs

Papacy and the sun, Wyclif says that a sun so liable to
eclipses is unnecessary; a thousand manifest examples prove
clearly that the Church can exist without it.³ The Papal claims
remind us of the latter days of the Church. Of all those who
are from all eternity doomed to be castaways, and therefore

every emperor. So was Sergius; but not therefore every monk.
Whoso deceives the people by Church censures, is above all
others an Antichrist. His helpers are those priests who in our
