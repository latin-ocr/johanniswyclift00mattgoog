deeds oi mercy. Secular power is also of two kinds: political
or general: the former belongs only to temporal rulers and
masters, the latter to the community at large; but the aim of
both is to attain for oneself and others all the good gifts of
nature and happiness. It follows that every man, qua a compound
ot' body and soul, possessas both general spiritual and secular
power; the latter, however, is not shared by children and idiote.
As spiritual power is from every point of view superior to
secular power, so the priestly power is also above that general
spiritual power aforesaid: but that it gives any right to temporal

either bestow or take it away; though he may have the right
to promulgate in due form that which God has commanded.
Such power can be neither augmented nor limited essentially3
but its exercise requires to be controlled. This power has been
given by God to those who deserve it, quite independently of
any outward sacerdotal character. Theresore, in the primitive
Church, the Apostles never (iared to say that they could delegate.
or limit, or take away this power; nor did even Simon Magus

is accused, and by no means excused, by St. Paul, and there
