7. The primacy of Peter was notin worldly dignity, might,
and renown, hut in humility and meekness, whereby he was
Christ's follower; such is the opinion of St. Bernard, who, both
orally and in his writings, has declared that the Pope should
have no temporal power, because the Papacy and tempora]
power, such as the laity are allowed to possess, are contrary

in general for every priest who, by imitating, shall resemble

And this knowledge is the knowledge of Holy Scripture, with·

others have abused it, hoarding up money, and making simple

people submit to their tyranny. If these abuses exist to·day,
under the forms of Excommunications and Absolutions, it is
the work of the God of this World, who dazzles all Christians
with his avidity and pride.

find room on board Christ’s ship; such as despise the world,
and walk in the ways of Our Lord. If the Pope does so, then
indeed is he Christ's Vicar.² Peter’s Vicar has for his duty to
