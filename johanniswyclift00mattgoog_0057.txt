The Cod.111F1=(=B; saeculi XV ineunt.) contains De
Blasphemia from f. 1 to f. hob, De Apostasia from f. hob to f.
134¹, on f. 134b there is: Conclusiones sex de hostia consecrata.
Incipit: Hostia consecrata quam videmus. It is therefore a part
of Wyclif's De Eucharistia conclusiones quindecim. See Shirley,
p. 10. From f. 134b to f223⁸ there is De Potestate Papo. The
index runs from f.226 to f. 228⁸; it is, like the index in A (Cod.
C. 73) incomplete, breaking off at the same sentence as above.
From f. 223 to f. 226 we have Wyclif's treatise De Vaticinacionc.
On the last cover are the words:

En redit e superis llus: Quid, si forte redibit
Zizkn tuus vindex? lmpir Roma, cave.

On the first: De Blasphemia pape, liber de simonia et
potestate pape, authore Viglepho Evangelico.

This MS. belongs to the first part of the XV. century,
and is therefore one of the most ancient Wyclif codices, and
has been hitherto treated with undeserved neglect. It deserves
in my opinion to be placed beside the famous MS. 1²94 of the
Hofbibliothek, Vienna, which contains Wyclif's De Ecclesia and
others; they both possess certain peculiarities which Ihave
also noticed in other Wyclif MSS, and which will require the
attention of students both of Wyclif and of Hus.

From what I have said, it will be seen that the two MSS.
are closely connected. It is worthy of note that in both the
contents are absolutely the same, and this extends even to
such short tractatos as De Prophetia. Then it is curious that
the index is incomplete and breaks off at the same words in
both cases. Looking closer, we see that the marginal notes
are, so to speak, identical. The mistakes in both codices are
for the most part the same. Now the question comes: Was B
copied from A, or A from B, or are they both from the same
original? But since we find that in B (on pp. 19, 94, 18, 102,
¹07 for instance, and on others besides) certain wordS, and
sometimes important ones, are missing, whilst they are to be
found in A, A cannot possibly have been copied from B, but
B was copied from A. We must remark here that the copyist
