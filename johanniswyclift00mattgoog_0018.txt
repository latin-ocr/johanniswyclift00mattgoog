on certain men for the greater edificatiou ol‘llis Church. Peter
obtained the primacy‚ not because of the fullness of his juris·
diction, but on account of his greater love for Christ and the
Church. Fitz-Ralph thinks that the Church must have a head,
and that this head was Peter; but according to the Decretal,
the Church was formerly ruled by a general council of priests,¹
and knew nothing ofa Sovereign Powerr It is also said that
Peter received special powers and means whereby to rule over
all men3 but his primacy was of another nature, not concerning
temporal dignities‚ but his duty to hearken to the little ones.⁸
Each of the Apostles had in a certain sense a universal juris·
diction in the Church; Paul above the others. To him, as the
representative of the clergy, is given the power of the keys;
not to the Roman Church as a special privilege.⁴ It was not
from Peter that Paul obtained his power; rather was Peter
himself sent to Samaria by the Apostles. How would i't
look today, if the College of Cardinals thought of sending the
Pope to convert a Pagan nationi But if they did, they would
thereby confer no dignity upon him. As all the Apostles were
friends, one obeyed the other and thought each worthier than
himself, and higher, and receiving directly from God the right
of Evangelical authority; even so should it be today.

From all this we may infer that the Pope should not
interfere in matters temporal, because the clergy has nothing
to do with them; he should renounce temporal splendour, be·
cause it does not tally with the priestly character; he must

watch over his flock and teach the Gospel in prayer and sanc·
tity of life.

ὁ. As none of the Apostles possessed such power as Christ
during His earthly life, so none of the Popes has such power
as Peter, or any Apostle. Popes cannot work miracles nor can
they write such books as the Bible: and this the Apostles did
