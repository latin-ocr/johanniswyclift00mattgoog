Christ in every respect, shall be called Pope. The Romans
make the Pope; so we are wont to say. But how did Rome
obtain such an honour? Argumeuts of pure reason, historical
fact, and necessity are pleaded here. ‘Because’, as Fitz-Ralph

tells us, ‘Rome is the capital of Christendom‘. But then we re·
proach Christ, who chose Jerusalem as the scene of His deeds
and sufferings, for not having preferred to reside in the metro·
polis of the Empire: and we also condemn those Popes who
dwell in Avignon. Rome is the chosen city3 but Rome was for
a long time less the capital of Christendom than of Heathen·
dom. Are not the Kingdoms of the Mongols iar greater attha
present day? This reason therefore for choosing Rome as the
Papal residence is worthless.¹ Fitz-Ralph has already said that
Rome and the Papacy are not necessarily connected;² so that
the second reason, holding that the ceutre of the world whither
all nations converge, must be the centra of Christianity, falls
to the ground. The third states that the Emperor and the Pope
work there together in harmony, for the good of the Church.
It is quite the contrary that has happened. Roman emperors,
such as Nero, Diocletian, and others, hindered the spread of
Christianity with all their might, Constantine, overburdening it
with lands and richeS, gave it poison.³ And the Roman Curia,
thanks to this endowment, has given to our princes examples
of all kinds of sin; and the clergy, waxing fat, has left off
teaching, admonishing, and punishing. The Popes before Con·
stantiae —- Peter, Clement, Marcellus and the others - acted
quite otherwise. To·day men have gone so far as evento say
that this temporal power is inherited in justice from God and
Peter, not from the Emperor; for God's power is supreme. Thus
spiritual duties have been disregarded in Rome, but emperors
and kings have been summoned and commanded to render
services, as masters order their servants. But the foundation oi
