It is an abuse of language to call every pseudo-pope a
Pope. When the Church became secularized, the Papacy and

the Roman See were separated. Radulphus de Diceto, dean of
St Paule, tells us how the Emperor Honorius put things to
rights when Eulalius set himself up against Pope Boniface. At
that time, Papacy was less spoken against, and this power
that had been usurped was not respected so much that a
secular ruler who confiscated the tempora] possessione and
dignities of aChurch that went astray should be considered as
a schismatic¹ From the same author Wyclif quotes a list of
depositione and of dissensione in the elections of the Popes,
which rendered it necessary for the secular judges to interfere.
“Then (says he) that law was still valid which empowered the
king, as Solomon of old (111. Reg. 11, 35), to depose the High
Priest.

The Pope was generally elected by the people of Rome,
before the secularisation of the Church, and the formation of
a sect unknown to Scripture — the Cardinals. Since the En·
dowment, every century has witnessed some great quarrel
amongst the Popes, the cause of which was greed of tempora]
dignities and possessions. Then‚ too, it might be said, as Christ
said: “Many will come in my name, and say that they are
Christ.’' That can only be said of the Bishops of Rome who
blasphemously assert themselves to be the Vicars of Our Lord.
But here again we should say, both of those of Avignon and
of the others, “Believe them not; their works show them all to
be Antichrists‚ whom we should flee.'’² This passage shows
clearly that Wyclifs attitude, even in respect to the obedience
due to Rome, is no longer what it was in 1378. And I believe
(he says) neither obedience has the conviction that their Pope

nutum invaluit usurpecio Romani pontificis, quod fuit reputatum hereticum, quod
domini temporales possent auferre temporalia, ymo dignitates etque officia ab ecclesia
delinquente p. 181. ² Debemus inniti Christi consilio quod secte divisione diebus
nostris quibusdem dicentibus: Ecce hic Avenione est Christus et eliis dicentibus: Nolite
credere, quie indubie opera tidelia oportet ostendere vicarium Christi . . . Opere eutem
ostendunt quod uterque eorum sit Antichristus et per consequeus fugiendus p. tesso.
