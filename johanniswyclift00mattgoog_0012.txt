are some who follow their example. 'she fault is two-fuld:
our negligence and the obstruction of Satan, which prevent us
from using the power we have. The latter should be striven
against, even should the strife end in martyrdom. Can power
bestowed by God be entirely lost? Temporal power lasts only
during a man's life. But to-day priests have less power than
the Apostles: a fact which should be noted by those who boast
of imaginary power. He has most, who edifies the Church the
most; and to this end a sufficient amount of power is given
to every man.

What has become of the power of working miracles, of
imparting the Holy Ghost‚ and of forgiving sins? Miracles are
worked by (iod alone3 if aman could work them, he would
be himself a God. Not even the Apostles dated to maintain
that they conferred the Holy Ghost; the Pope cannot do that.
If he could, he would be God. God alone imparts His Holy
Spirit, and forgives the sins of such as, by prayer and meri·
torious deeds, have deserved forgiveness. This, and not the
imaginary sacerdotal power of forgiving sins, ought to be
believed by every Christian. The Apostles themselves many a
time averred that they had no power but that of edifying the
Churoh.¹ How exalted soever aBishop may be, he cannot absolve
one whom (iod does not absolve; and a simple priest‚ nay, a
layman, has in this respect as much power as the Pope. No
one should take upon himself the right either of absolving or
of excommunicating‚ or of inflicting any other penalty; and
if he usurps functions that are not his, he is the servant of
the devil.

How does (iod transfer powers? how does He bestow them?
and which power is the most exalted? The transfer takes place
through inspiration, without regard to external signs and rites.
Τὴιιε it was with Moses and with the Apostles, who were
ordained without external signs. Had any other form of ordin-
ation been requisita we should find it mentioned in Scripture.
As to the various divisione of these powers, we must consult
