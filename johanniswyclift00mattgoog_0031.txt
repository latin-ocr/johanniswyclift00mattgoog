according to this principle, when the election hasbeen due to
military force or a tumult of the people;¹ in other words, when,
as for Urban vl, the choice being due to a riot is null and
void, is not the man whose election was caused by the devil
or the sins of the electorS, to be considered rather as an apo-
state than as Peter’s successor? No one who is not the son oi
Christ and Peter can be Pope. This cannot be the result of
an election made by men, and so such an election has no
power to make aPope. That a man chosen by the Western
Church should receive the name of Pope is an abuse3 it has

Our chronicles show the growth of Papacy to be caused

the authority of Rome would be destroyed. Resides, the laws
made by the Popes concerning obedience to the Church of
Rome, should be understood as supposing that this Church
should be capable of performing its taslc

refuto. If it be said that the Pope ought to be the most mighty

required of him as a duty; that his inferiors in temporal power
would not keep their places, and lastly that temporal power
is not a drawback, but a privilege, and that it ought therefore
to be upheld: Christ’s example teaches the contrary. The legate
Otho attempted in the year 1226 to extort money3 but John
Marshall most energetically withstood this attempt. Indead, the
claim then made by the Roman Curia was scandalous. If the
Curia bas been maintained for centuries by the alms oi the
