tely discredited these men;¹ it ,is n0 longer believed that they
possess Primacy in the Churcthilitant. As a matter of fact,
no prelate can rightly boast ol any such power; because he
does not know firstly, whether he really possesses it; secondly,
whether he does not commit mortal sin in the exercise thereos,
and thirdly, whether one of his inferiors does not stand higher
than he.

These modern Pharisees, in order to maintain their power,
fall into heresy; they say that God has made with thern a
covenant, to bind or loose as they may decide. What blas·
phemyl Deep >humility would suit the Pope far better than such
arrogance, which is an attribute of Antichrist. Instead of being
puffed up with worldly glory, he should seek his reward in
secret, like a follower of Christ. From all this we see how great
a fallacy it is to determine by human election who shall be
Pope or any other Church dignitary; for the choice of man
gives no right whatever. And therefore, if Robert in Avignon‚
or Urban in Rome, or any other, claims to be the supreme
Head of the English Church, it means that we should shun him
as an Antichrist.‘-' Their true Primate, who will bear all respon·
sibility for them at Judgment Day, will serve them humbly,
renouncing all honours. It was thus that the Saints understood
Primacy. They knew that the choice ol men was not necessary,
and was dangerous to it,³ They knew what great trouble, what
heavy responsibility it entails; but our Prelates do not want
trouble, but only power and temporal rewards.

A wrong choice makes a man, not apostolical, but an
apostate.⁴ An election made by men is either right or wrong,
as it corresponds or does not correspond to God's choice. But
