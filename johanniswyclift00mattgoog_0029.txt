form a body unwarranted by Scripture3 neither their name nor
their institution is mentioned therein. Most of them are not
even priests; in no way do they corne in the name of the Lord,
but only, like Gehazi and Simon, to take Church property and
money. They can work no miracles, they do not pray or preach
either for those who have instituted them or who approve
their deeds. How then can such monsters have received the

and to increase their worldly dignity and their imaginary
holiness: for all those doctors who expect temporal remuner-
ation from the Roman Curia flatter it and say that this power
is boundless, because it is able to do all that Christ did on
earth, and even more. In reality, a faithful priest of Christ has
no power to absolve; he can merely proclaim God's sentence
that the sinner is forgiven. Whoever misuses the Power of the
KeyS, and sets himself in opposition to the Church Triumphant,

loses that power by the very fact. Such abuses have comple·
